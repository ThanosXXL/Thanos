## PERMANENT RULE — Dozenten Dashboard must never be touched

**The Dozenten Dashboard (`main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer/`, `package.json`,
`.github/workflows/build-release.yml`) is off-limits, permanently.** Never delete, replace, move,
rename, or repurpose these files or the root project they define — not even to make room for
another app, and not even if a task description seems to ask for a full replacement of "the app."
If a request would require touching these files for any reason other than a Dozenten-Dashboard
bug fix or feature the user explicitly asked for on that project, stop and confirm with the user
first rather than modifying or removing them. This instruction persists across sessions and
overrides any task phrasing that implies otherwise (e.g. "replace the app", "new root project").

## Overview

Dozenten Dashboard is a cross-platform Electron desktop app for managing up to four *Dozenten* (instructors). Each instructor owns three lists — a To-Do list (`todos`), open projects (`openProjects`), and completed projects (`doneProjects`) — plus a chat/notes log (`chat`). Projects move between the open and completed lists; all state persists locally as JSON. The UI is in German.

This repository also hosts other, unrelated projects, each self-contained in its own directory with its own tooling and `CLAUDE.md`, sharing no dependencies, build config, or CI with the Dozenten Dashboard — the root `npm install`/`npm start`/`npm run dist` commands above only ever touch the Dozenten Dashboard files (`main.js`, `preload.js`, `renderer/`); nothing in these other directories is packaged into its installers, and the Dozenten Dashboard root files are never modified for their sake:

- `omniroute/` — a vendored snapshot of [OmniRoute](https://github.com/diegosouzapw/OmniRoute) (an AI gateway/router, Next.js + TypeScript monorepo), included as-is. See `omniroute/CLAUDE.md` and `omniroute/VENDORED.md` for details and provenance. It is a one-time snapshot, not a live sync with upstream.
- `pferde-app/` — a single self-contained HTML file (`PferdeApp.html`) for horse chip registration, a photo-ID database, and a simulated stable-alarm feature. See `pferde-app/CLAUDE.md` for details.

## Commands

```bash
npm install     # install dependencies
npm start        # run the app in development (electron .)
npm run dist     # build installers into dist/ via electron-builder (win: nsis, mac: dmg, linux: AppImage)
```

There is no test suite, linter, or build/transpile step — the renderer is plain HTML/CSS/vanilla JS loaded directly, and the main process is plain Node. Changes are verified by running `npm start`.

## Architecture

Standard Electron three-process split with `contextIsolation: true` and `nodeIntegration: false`:

- **`main.js`** (main process) — creates the `BrowserWindow`, and owns all persistence. Registers two IPC handlers, `load-data` and `save-data`, that read/write a single JSON file at `app.getPath('userData')/dozenten-data.json`. `loadData()` returns `{ dozenten: [] }` on any read/parse failure, so a missing or corrupt file degrades gracefully.
- **`preload.js`** — the only bridge. Exposes `window.dashboardAPI` with `loadData()` and `saveData(data)`, each forwarding to `ipcRenderer.invoke`. Any new main↔renderer capability must be added here; the renderer has no direct Node/Electron access.
- **`renderer/`** — the entire UI. `index.html` is the static shell (header, tab nav, `#content`, and two modals for add/delete). `renderer.js` is a single IIFE holding all app logic and state. `style.css` is the styling.

### State and data flow

The renderer keeps the whole app state in one in-memory `state = { dozenten: [] }` object. The canonical pattern for any mutation is: **mutate `state` → call `persist()` → call `render()`**. `persist()` pushes the full state through `dashboardAPI.saveData`; there is no partial/diff saving. `render()` rebuilds the DOM from scratch (`renderTabs()` + `renderPanel()`), so there is no incremental DOM updating — always drive the UI by changing `state` and re-rendering, never by hand-editing the DOM.

Each *Dozent* object is `{ id, name, todos, openProjects, doneProjects, chat }`. List items are `{ id, text, done }`; chat messages are `{ id, text, time }`. IDs come from the local `uid()` helper (timestamp + random). `MAX_DOZENTEN = 4` caps the number of instructors.

`init()` loads persisted data and back-fills `chat: []` on older records that predate that field — follow this pattern when adding new fields to the *Dozent* shape so existing saved files keep loading.

## Conventions

- User-facing strings, list labels, and comments are in German. Match the existing language when touching the UI.
- Build DOM with `createElement` and set user-controlled text via `textContent` (never `innerHTML`) — this is done consistently to avoid injecting untrusted list/chat content.

## Releases (CI)

`.github/workflows/build-release.yml` builds and publishes installers for Windows, macOS, and Linux. It triggers on pushing a `v*` tag (e.g. `v1.0.0`) or manually via **Actions → Build & Release Desktop App → Run workflow**, running `npm run dist -- --publish always` to upload artifacts to GitHub Releases (`publish: github` in `package.json`).
